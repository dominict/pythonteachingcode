    "|:-------------------------------|  \n",
    "| **NOTE:** This program requires `print` output and using code syntax used in module 1 such as variable assignment, `input`, `in` keyword, `.lower()` or `.upper()` method. It also requires that your name be spelled out in the code of the code file that you submit. Dynamically capturing your name when the program runs and then having it display in the output is not enough. This is true of all other required code assignments too. |  \n",

Then, paste in your code and test it. Finally, save the file and upload it to D2L to submit. Be sure to test that it works. Use this same process for all Required Code Activities."
