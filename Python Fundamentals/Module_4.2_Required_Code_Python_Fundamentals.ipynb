This is not Python. Rather, it is a command issued straight to the operating system to \"**C**apture the contents of a **URL** -> **CURL**\". The exclamation point tells Jupyter to send the command to the operating system. If you move this code to a .py file to run as a script, you would need another method to capture the URL contents to a file. Python includes a standard os module for this purpose. You will need to import os and then put your command as a string in a variable named something like cmd. After that, you would need to run the line os.system(cmd).\n",
